# My PT App Client Side

This repository contains the screenshots and packages used in a Flutter and Firebase project for the client side of an app to help personal trainers manage their clients. Various Flutter packages are used, including many Firebase SDKs (these can be found in the pubspec.yaml file). In addition an extensive use of Firebase features are implemented in this project such as Cloud Functions, Cloud Messaging, Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore. 

The src code for the cloud functions can be found in the 'cloud functions' folder. Here typescript is used for the Cloud Functions to create backend functionality such as firebase triggers and the use of the express package to make custom http calls.

The app allows clients to receive diet plans, exercise plans, various tutorials as well as communicate with their coach on a one-to-one basis. The client is also able to track their body weight as well as their strength. The client has an account where they can make changes to their display picture and other details such as their phone number.
