# My PT App Client Side

This repository contains the screenshots and packages used in a Flutter and Firebase project for the client side of an app to help personal trainers manage their clients. Various Flutter packages were used in the development of this project, including many Firebase SDKs (these can be found in the pubspec.yaml file). In addition an extensive use of Firebase features were implemented in this project such as Cloud Functions, Cloud Messaging, Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore. The app allows personal trainers to set diet plans, exercise plans, post various tutorials as well as communicate with their clients on a one-to-one basis. The client is also able to track their body weight as well as their strength. The client will have an account where they can make changes to their display picture and other details such as their phone number.
